If not, you will need to add the component as a module to your application. Add the entry 'Zend\\Mvc\\Plugin\\FilePrg' to your list of modules in your application configuration (typically one of config/application.config.php or config/modules.config.php ). Usage While similar to the Post/Redirect/Get Plugin , the File PRG Plugin will work for forms with file inputs. The difference is in the behavior: The File PRG Plugin will interact directly with your form instance and the file inputs, rather than only returning the POST params from the previous request. By interacting directly with the form, the File PRG Plugin will turn off any file inputs required flags for already uploaded files (for a partially valid form state), as well as run the file input filters to move the uploaded files into a new location (configured by the user). Files must be relocated on upload You must attach a filter for moving the uploaded files to a new location, such as the RenameUpload Filter , or else your files will be removed upon the redirect. This plugin is invoked with three arguments: $form : the Zend\\Form\\Form instance. $redirect : (Optional) a string containing the redirect location, which can either be a named route or a URL, based on the contents of the third parameter. If this argument is not provided, it will default to the current matched route. $redirectToUrl : (Optional) a boolean that when set to true , causes the second parameter to be treated as a URL instead of a route name (this is required when redirecting to a URL instead of a route). This argument defaults to false . Example Usage $myForm = new Zend\\Form\\Form('my-form'); $myForm->add([ 'type' => 'Zend\\Form\\Element\\File', 'name' => 'file', ]); // NOTE: Without a filter to move the file, // our files will disappear between the requests $myForm->getInputFilter()->getFilterChain()->attach( new Zend\\Filter\\File\\RenameUpload([ 'target' => './data/tmpuploads/file', 'randomize' => true, ]) ); // Pass in the form and optional the route/url you want to redirect to after the POST $prg = $this->fileprg($myForm, '/user/profile-pic', true); if ($prg instanceof Zend\\Http\\PhpEnvironment\\Response) { // Returned a response to redirect us. return $prg; } if ($prg === false) { // First time the form was loaded. return ['form' => $myForm]; } // Form was submitted. // $prg is now an array containing the POST params from the previous request, // but we don't have to apply it to the form since that has already been done. // Process the form if ($form->isValid()) { // ...Save the form... return $this->redirect()->toRoute('/user/profile-pic/success'); } // Form not valid, but file uploads might be valid and uploaded $fileErrors = $form->get('file')->getMessages(); if (empty($fileErrors)) { $tempFile = $form->get('file')->getValue(); }","title":"Home"},{"location":"#installation","text":"Install via composer: $ composer require zendframework/zend-mvc-plugin-fileprg If you are using the zend-component-installer , you're done!
